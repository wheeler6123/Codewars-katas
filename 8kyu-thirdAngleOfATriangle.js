/*You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.

Write a function to return the 3rd.

Note: only positive integers will be tested.*/


//P: input will be two positive integers representing 2 of the 3 angles of a triangle
//R: given the two angles provided, return the third angle
//E: (30,60) => 90
  //(60,60) => 60
//P: function(a1,a2){
  //calculate third angle
  //return
//}
