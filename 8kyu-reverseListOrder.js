/*In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

Examples (Input -> Output)
* [1, 2, 3, 4]  -> [4, 3, 2, 1]
* [9, 2, 0, 7]  -> [7, 0, 2, 9]*/


//P: input will be an array, indications are that it will contain a list of integers and will not be empty
//R: return the list of numbers in reverse order of the input
//E: [1,2,3,4] => [4,3,2,1]
//P: return the input using the reverse method


const reverseList = a => a.reverse()
