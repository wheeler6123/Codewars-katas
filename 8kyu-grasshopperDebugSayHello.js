/*Debugging sayHello function
The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

Example output:

Hello, Mr. Spock*/



//P: input will be a string containing someone's name, no indication that it could possibly be empty
//R: return a greeting using the input name
//E: 'Mr. Spock' => 'Hello, Mr. Spock'
//P: use template literal to respond with Hello, {name}

const sayHello = name => `Hello, ${name}`
